\arguments{
\item{Y_mat_or}{an nxT matrix of outcome.}

\item{W_mat_or}{an nxT matrix of endogenous treatment.}

\item{Z}{n nx1 vector of an aggregate instrument.}

\item{share_t}{the share of the learning period.}

\item{share_rank}{the share of the rank of generalized fixed effects matrix in total rank.}

\item{no_noise}{If true, the noise is not added. We do not add noise for table 3.}

\item{rho_agg}{the share of Z_t during H_t generation.}

\item{rho_theta_w}{the exposure of W (endogenous treatment) to unobserved confounder.}

\item{rho_theta_y}{the exposure of Y (outcome) to unobserved confounder.}

\item{B}{number of replications for each design of simulation.}

\item{S}{if 'test' == TRUE, the number of simulations for standard error estimation.}

\item{test}{If true, compute the tests for the coverage rates.}

\item{return_table}{If true, instead of printing table(s) the function returns it(them).}

\item{K}{number of domain splits. It is used in density plot.}

\item{deg}{degrees of freedom for natural cubic splines. It is used in density plot.}

\item{draw_plot}{If true, the 2 density plots are drawn.}

\item{height}{the height of the plot.}

\item{width}{the width of the plot.}

\item{plot_folder}{The folder where the plot is saved. NULL stands for the working directory.}

\item{save_pdf}{If true, the 2 density plots for Original and Robust estimators are saved.}

\item{save_sim}{If true, the function saves the simulation.}

\item{sim_folder}{If 'save_sim' is true, the folder where the simulation is saved. NULL stands for the working directory.}

\item{sim_name}{If 'save_sim' is true, the folder where the simulation is saved.}

\item{seed}{seed to set.}
